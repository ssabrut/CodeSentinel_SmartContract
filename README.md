# CodeSentinel_SmartContract

This project is a basic, decentralized voting system created using a Solidity smart contract. It allows for the creation of proposals and for users to vote on them. The contract is designed to be deployed and tested on an Ethereum test network using the Remix IDE.

## Features

* Add Proposals: Anyone can add a new proposal to the voting list.
* Vote on Proposals: Anyone can vote for an existing proposal. Each address can only vote once.
* View Vote Count: Check the vote count for any proposal.

## Technologies Used

* Solidity: The smart contract is written in Solidity, the primary language for Ethereum smart contracts.
* Remix IDE: An open-source web and desktop application for contract development. It's used here for writing, compiling, deploying, and interacting with the smart contract.
* Ethereum Test Network: The contract is deployed on a test network (like Sepolia or Goerli via Remix's injected provider) to simulate a real blockchain environment without using real Ether.
* MetaMask (Optional): A crypto wallet that can be used to interact with the deployed contract, simulating real-world transactions.
